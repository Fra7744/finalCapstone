### **DESCRIPTION**: The Holiday calculator is an interactive application that help people
calculate the total cost of their holiday in one of five destinations by taking three elements:
1. Item 1: destination
2. Item 2: number of days in the hotel
3. Item 3: number of days they would like to hire a car for.
At its core there are three functions, one per question.

### **Installation:** The app can be installed by just copying and running the code into your
local machine.

### **Usage:** The holiday calculator allows users to know how much their holiday will cost
by answering three simple questions that describe the holiday (destination, number of
nights in the hotel, number of days they want to rent their car). The application can be run
from any Python editor by just opening the file and start answering the first question.
Eventually, it will display the total amount plus all the details entered.

### **License:** The holiday calculator is an open source, free to use application.
